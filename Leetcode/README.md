# ðŸ§  Leetcode Problem Solutions in Python

## Overview

This folder contains solutions to various Leetcode problems that demonstrate different algorithmic techniques and data structure usage. These problems are commonly asked in technical interviews at top tech companies. Each solution includes explanations and complexity analysis to help understand the approach.

## Quick Run Instructions

To run any of the Python files in this folder, use the following command:

```bash
python3 filename.py
```

For example, to run the array rotation problem:

```bash
python3 right_rotate_array_by_k_places.py
```

Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system. You can check by running:

```bash
python3 --version
```

## Problems/Algorithms

| File | Problem Description | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|------|---------------------|----------------|------------------|
| [right_rotate_array_by_k_places.py](right_rotate_array_by_k_places.py) | Rotate array to the right by k positions | O(n) | O(1) |

## Notes / Gotchas

- Leetcode problems often have multiple approaches with different trade-offs
- Pay attention to edge cases like empty inputs, single element arrays, and maximum/minimum values
- Some problems can be optimized significantly by using mathematical properties or built-in functions
- Space complexity can often be improved by in-place operations
- Time complexity analysis is crucial for understanding algorithm efficiency
- Consider both brute force and optimized solutions during problem solving
